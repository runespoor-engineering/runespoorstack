# Changelog Manager: Tech Insights

**Note:** This CLI is designed to work with Continuous Integration / Trunk Based Development workflows.

## What is the problem?

- The problem over changelog and semantic versioning management in **single** repositories.

### Solution

`@runespoor/changelog-manager` CLI package. With the following functionality allowed by `rune` command`:

`rune change`
--

**Description**:
Asks a series of questions and then generates a `<branchname>-<timestamp>.json` file in the common folder. 
The `apply` command will consume these files and perform the proper version bumps. Note these changes will eventually be published in 
a `CHANGELOG.md` file in the root of the repository. The possible types of changes are: MAJOR - these are breaking changes that are 
not backward compatible. Examples are: renaming a public class, adding/removing a non-optional parameter from a public API, or 
renaming a variable or function that is exported. MINOR - these are changes that are backward compatible (but not forward compatible). 
Examples are: adding a new public API or adding an optional parameter to a public API PATCH - these are changes that are backward and 
forward-compatible. Examples are: Modifying a private API or fixing a bug in the logic of how an existing API works. NONE - these are 
changes that are backward and forwards compatible and don't require an immediate release. Examples are Modifying dev tooling 
configurations like eslint.

When to run the command?
- Before each Merge Request or direct push to the main branch.

**Usage**:
```
rune change
```

**Optional arguments**:
```
Optional arguments:
  -h, --help                                  Show this help message and exit.
  -t, --targetBranch <source-branch-name>     name of the target branch
```
`
**Functionality**: 
- Should fetch the latest changes from the remote repository.
- Should get the current branch name and target branch name (main/master) or use the provided target one.
- Should ask to **describe** the changes. Message: `Describe the changes:`.
- Should ask to select the **changes type**: `minor` / `major` / `patch` / `none` (described below). Message: `Choose the changes type:`.
- Should create the **change file**.
  - File name should follow the convention: `<branch-name>_yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss-ms.json`.
  - File should be located in the `<root>/changes` directory.
  - File should have the following specific structure (described below).
  - If there were no new commits comparing with the default branch (`main` or `master`) or the provided target one,
  should print the following message and exit with status code 0: `Info: No new commits found in the current branch. Please make sure you have committed your changes and your branch is ahead of origin/main`
  - If the **change file** already exists, should ask if the user needs to `overwrite` it. Message: `The change file already exists. Do you want to overwrite it? (y/n)`. 
  If user chooses `n`, the command will be finished with status code 0. 
  If user chooses `y`, the command will continue, the new change file should be generated and the old one should be deleted.

**Additional info**:

The possible types of changes are: 
- **minor** - these are breaking changes that are not backward compatible. Examples are: renaming a public class, adding/removing a non-optional parameter from a public API, or renaming a variable or function that is exported. 
- **major** - these are changes that are backward compatible (but not forward compatible). Examples are: adding a new public API or adding an optional parameter to a public API.
- **patch** - these are changes that are backward and forward-compatible. Examples are: Modifying a private API or fixing a bug in the logic of how an existing API works. 
- **none** - these are changes that are backward and forward-compatible and don't require an immediate release. Examples are: Modifying dev tooling configurations like eslint.

Specific **change file** structure:
```
{
  "comment": "<description>",
  "type": "<major/minor/patch/none",
  "author": "GitUserName"
}
```

`rune verify`
--

**Description**:
Verifies that change files are provided and are valid.

When to run the command?
- In the CI workflow on each Merge Request.

**Usage**:
```
rune change
```

**Optional arguments**:
```
Optional arguments:
  -h, --help                                  Show this help message and exit.
  -s, --sourceBranch <source-branch-name>     name of the source branch (required in the CI)
  -t, --targetBranch <source-branch-name>     name of the target branch
```

**Functionality**:
- Should fetch the latest changes from the remote repository.
- Should get the current branch name and default branch name (main/master) or use the provided once.
- Should verify that there are new commits in the current branch comparing with the default branch or do the same with the provided source and target branches.
  - If there are no new commits, should print message and exit with status code 0: `Success: No new commits found in the current branch. Change files are not required.`
  - If verification fails, should print error message and exit with status code 1: `Error: Failed to verify branch commits. Error: <error message>`
- Should verify that change file exists and follows the naming convention.
  - If change file doesn't exist, should print error message and exit with status code 1: `Error: No change files found. Please run 'rune change' to generate change files.`
  - If change file name is invalid, should print error message and exit with status code 1: `Error: Invalid change file name. Expected format: <branch-name>_yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss-ms.json`
- If verification passes, should print success message with change file path and return the path: `Success: Found change file: <change-file-path>`

`rune apply`
--

**Description**:

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -t, --targetBranch <source-branch-name>     name of the target branch(required in the CI)
```

**Functionality**: 

- Should create changelog files if it doesn't exist.
- Should get the date from change files names.
- Should read change files data.
- Should read package.json data to get current version.
- Should bump the package version according to the change types:
  - If change type is `none`, should not bump the version.
  - If version bump fails, should print error message and exit with status code 1: `Error: Failed to bump package version.`
- Should modify package.json with the new version.
- Should modify changelog file with:
