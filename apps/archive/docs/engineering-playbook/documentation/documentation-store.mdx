# Documentation First Approach

This page describes where and why you should store you documentation.

## Where to store the documentation

- Store the documentation in the same repository as the code in **markdown** files or in the separate `documentation` repository.
- If you have a client side app, you could deploy your documentation into Storybook.
- If you don't use Storybook, use [Docusarus](https://docusaurus.io/) to deploy the documentation. P.S. Use monorepo.

## What to store as the documentation

- Everyting: documents as markdown files, images, mermaid/draw.io/excalidraw diagrams, links, etc.

## Why to store the documentation as a code

- To notify every engineer teammate about the changes in the documentation - the approve from an engineer will be a notification that he read the documentation.
- Documentation must be reviewed similarly to the code.
- To have a history of changes in the documentation.
- To have a possibility to revert the documentation to the previous state.
