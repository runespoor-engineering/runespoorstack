# High Level Requirements and Purposes

On this page I have provided the basic tamplate for creating the first document of you startup idea.

**WARNING:** Only the title and general structure is important in the template. Other text in the code blocks was provided just an example.

## Name and Domain Area

```
Software name and description of the domain area and end users.
```

## Basis for Development

```
1. What is the basis for the development of `<software-name>`?
2. What is the purpose of development?
3. What is the functional and operational purpose of the program or software product?
```

## Requirements for Software

### Requirements for Functional Characteristics

The software should provide the execution of the following main functions:

**User Interface**:
```
- Function 1;
- Function 2, and so on.

Include the UI mockups here.
```

**For the User**:
```
- Function 1;
- Function 2, and so on.
```


**For the system administrator (if applicable)**:
```
- Function 1;
- Function 2, and so on.
```


**Additional Requirements**:
```
- Function 1;
- Function 2, and so on.
```


### Reliability Requirements

```
Provide input information control and protection against incorrect user actions. Ensure the integrity of information in the database
(if the software includes a database).
```

### Type of Service needed for your Software

```
Specify the type of service required for development. Specify that "Service type requirements are not specified" if the development does not require
special servicing.
```

### Servicing Staff

```
If necessary, specify the main servicing operations, the required number, and qualification of personnel. 
Specify that "Requirements for servicing personnel are not specified" if the development does not require servicing personnel.
```

### Requirements for the hardware technical characteristic needed for you software

```
Specify the type, composition, and characteristics of hardware.

Minimum tech configuration:
- Processor type: Intel Core i5;
- RAM capacity: 4 GB;
- Internet connection with a speed of at least 20 megabits;
- ...

Recommended techn configuration (and on which the development was carried out):
- Processor type: Intel Core i7;
- RAM capacity: 8 GB;
- Internet connection with a speed of at least 100 megabits;
- ...
```

### Requirements for Informational and Software Compatibility

```
The software should operate under the management of operating systems from the WIN32 family (Windows'XP, Windows NT, etc.) or Unix.
```

### Requirements for Tech Stack

```
- Development should be done in the programming language...
```

### Requirements for Development Environment

```
Development should be carried out on the platform (using the environment)...
```

### Requirements for Versioning and Packaging

```
- npm registry: ...
- Keep the sematic versioning
```

### Requirements for Transportation and Storage

```
No requirements for transportation and storage are specified.
```

### Special Requirements

```
No special requirements.
