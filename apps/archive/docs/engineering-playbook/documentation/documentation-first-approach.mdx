# Documentation First Approach

> Document it before you do it.

> If something is not written down, it didn't happen

Documentation First Approach is a methodology that emphasizes the importance of creating documentation before starting the development process or any another one. 

## Why documentation first?

- This approach helps in setting clear expectations, aligning the team, and ensuring that the project is well-documented from the beginning. 
- It also helps in identifying potential issues early and provides a reference point for future development.
