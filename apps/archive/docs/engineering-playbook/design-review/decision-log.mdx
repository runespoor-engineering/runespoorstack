# Decision Log

This document is used to track key decisions that are made during the course of the project. This can be used at a later stage to understand why decisions were made and by whom.

## Benefits

1. **Transparency & Accountability** – A Decision Log ensures all key project decisions are documented, making it clear who made each decision and why, fostering accountability within the team. 

2. **Historical Reference** – Teams can revisit past decisions to understand the reasoning and alternatives considered, preventing redundant discussions and rework.  

3. **Continuity for New Team Members** – New team members can quickly get up to speed by reviewing past decisions, reducing the learning curve and ensuring consistency in project direction.  

4. **Efficient Decision-Making** – By keeping a structured record, teams can make informed choices faster, avoiding repeated debates on previously resolved issues.  

5. **Risk Management** – Documenting decisions helps teams identify potential risks and dependencies, ensuring that changes are made with full awareness of past considerations.
