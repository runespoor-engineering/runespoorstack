# Basic Authentication

It is a mechanism to authenticate access to the resource over HTTP.

Credentials are sent in the request headers in the form of `Authorization: Basic <base64 encoded username and password>`.

This is basic authentication in play!

## How does it work?

1. Client tries to access some protected URL or other resource.
2. Server checks if the request contains the `Authorization` **header with valid username and password**.
    - _(Success)_ If it exists and is valid, the server sends the requested resource and `status: 200`. 
    - _(Go to step 3)_ If credentials don't exists or are invalid, the server sends `status: 401` and the `WWW-Authenticate` header with the `Basic realm="Restricted Area"` value.
3. The client receives the `401` status and the `WWW-Authenticate` header and shows the login form.
4. The client fills in the form and sends the request again. The credentials are encoded using `base64` and sent in the `Authorization` header. `base64(username:password)`.
5. _(Go to step 2)_ Continue cycle.

**Note:** 
- Basic auth is not considered secure unless used with TSL/HTTPS. Because anyone can intercept the request and decode the credentials.
- Basic auth can also be used in APIs, but in that case it is just like normal token-based authentication.
