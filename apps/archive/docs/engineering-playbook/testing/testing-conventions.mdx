# Testing Conventions

## General conventions for tests

- Follow the [Testing Trophy](/docs/engineering-playbook/testing/ideal-testing-trophy).
- Follow the [Test Desiderata](/docs/engineering-playbook/testing/test-desiderata).
- [Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests).
- [Follow the AHA testing](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-testing).
- Separate the test cases. - One case - one test.
- [Avoid mutable variables.](https://x.com/kentcdodds/status/1154468901121482753?s=20).
- [Avoid nesting when you are testing](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-nesting-when-youre-testing).
- Keep tests up to date. - If you add the code for some method component/method/class, you should update all the current test cases and cover the new part of functionality with tests.
- Bad tests is worth than no tests. - If you don't know how to cover some functionality with tests, if you understand that your tests are bad - don't push 1-2 useless test cases to master!
- If you use TDD, you should follow [the correct TDD flow](/docs/engineering-playbook/testing/tdd).

## Integration/Component Tests

- Use [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).
- Follow the [priotiry of React Testing Library queries](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about#priority).
- Use the specified [HTML ARIA-roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles) for `...ByRole()` query. 
- Use `@testing-library/user-event` for [simulating user interactions](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/intro/).
- [Avoid common mistakes with React Testing Library](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library).
- Use custom `render`, `renderHook` that contains all the general Providers. 
  - If you need some specific Provider, you can add it in the test case.
  - If you are going to use some Provider in the test case and understand that it is a global/general Provider - add it to the custom methods.
- [Do not test the implementation details in Integration tests](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/testing-implementation-details).
- [Do not use shallow rendering](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/why-i-never-use-shallow-rendering).
- Test components in isolation. Each test case should render the component from zero.

## Mocking

The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.

- [Understand that mocking is a tradeoff between speed and confindence](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-merits-of-mocking).
- [Do the mocks of server api calls correclty](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-mocking-fetch). Use `msw` for mocking REST api.
- Follow basic example of [React Testing Library + msw API mocking](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/example-intro/#full-example).
- Turn off [query retries for Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/testing#turn-off-retries).
- Mock system Timezone to remove the uncpected behavior with date. See the [Vitest example](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/1575#issuecomment-1439286286).
- Your mocks should be organized in one style. - It is just as important as organizing your other code and files.

## Style Guide

- Use `mixins/jest` or `mixins/vitest` and `mixins/testing-library-react` from [@runespoor/eslint-config](https://github.com/runespoor-engineering/runespoorstack/tree/main/eslint/eslint-config).
- The test file should be located in the `__tests__/unit` or `__tests__/integration` folder, depending on the tests type. - It will help to run unit and integration test separatly.
- The tests should be located in the same folder as the component/method/class you are testing.
- The name of the test file should be the same as the component/method/class you are testing, but with the `.test` suffix.
- `describe`:
  - Do not use nested `describe`.
  - The message should be the name of the component/method/class your are testing.
  - Example: `describe('useEntitiesMap', () => {})`
  - Use separte `describe` for covering corner cases in the same testing file. It might be useful when you fix bugs and want to decrease the bugs repetition.
    - Example: `describe('useEntitiesMap (corner cases)', () => {})`
- `it`:
  - The message should be started with `should` word.
  - The message should be in the **present tense**.
  - Use `` ` ` `` quotes for all the technical names (props, args, handlers, hooks, etc.).
  - Example: ``it('should skip the entity if it does not have an object by the provided `entityDataPath`', () => {})``
- Mocks:
  - The name of the mock function or constant should be started with `mock` word. (not `mocking` , not `mocked` )
