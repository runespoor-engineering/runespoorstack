# Impact Analysis

Let's imagine the typical workflow of testing a merge request for an average coder 🛠️:

- We write code, add a new feature, gather our thoughts and spirit, and for some reason, refactor one of the existing modules/components to meet our needs. 📝
- We run the project locally, test our new feature, and... (oh, what a surprise) forget about the changes in the existing component. 😅
- The feature works and the tests pass ⇒ we deploy our changes and hand over the task to QA titled "Test the New Feature." 🚀
- QA tests the new feature, and of course, it works. Everyone is happy. 😃
- Release time comes. 🚢
- A few days later, we receive a defect issue. It turns out the problem was caused by that minor change in the module. 😱

In this flow, there are no culprits. The developer forgot that the modified module is used in different parts of the code, and the tester couldn't possibly know about it.

But how can we deal with such incidents? As it is known, 90% of problems that exist in software development can be addressed. 🤔

## Impact Analysis 💥

The name speaks for itself. It is a method in which you describe which modules are affected and to what extent by your changes. We will talk about the integration of DEV-QA. In other words, when a developer makes changes to the code, they should describe the impact on the rest of the system. 🔄

Why should we do this?

- By describing the Impact Analysis, the developer can understand, find, and verify the correctness of the affected parts of the program. 🔍
- The developer starts to better understand the relationships between components in the system. 🧩
- The developer provides more context for code reviewers, thus sharing their knowledge about the program. 💡
- The developer informs the QA specialist about which components of the system need to be tested. 📢

In simple terms, an impact analysis should include the following points:

- A brief description of the essence of your changes.
- How the system components behaved before your changes. ⬅️
- How the system components behave after your changes. ➡️
- Which modules did you affect with your changes?
- Which modules depend on the changes you made?
- An assessment of the impact of your changes on the other parts of the system. 🔄
- A description of the impact of your changes on the other parts of the system.

Overall, it's quite straightforward.

*"How much impact do your changes have on the other parts of the system?"* - You can provide a numerical rating, for example, from 1 to 3.

- 1 impact point - low impact
- 2 impact points - medium impact
- 3 impact points - strong impact

But what I can also recommend is visualizing the last 3 points. It will help you quickly orient yourself in your impact analysis. 📊
