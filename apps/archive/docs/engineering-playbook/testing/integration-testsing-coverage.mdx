# Integration Testing Coverage

Do you need to cover ALL the components with integration tests?
Let's visualize the test coverage for both variants:

![Integration Testing Coverage](/img/integrationTestingCoverage.png)

As we know, shallow rendering is a bad idea. So we are going to write the full tests suit for our component. Let’s start our testing step by step.

## Covering all the components

1. Writing the tests for components **`B and C`.**
2. Writing the tests for component **`A`.** But wait … I want to cover all the scenarios. Okay, component **`A`** is built using **`B and C`** ones, so I could just copy the test suits from them and paste them inside the **`A`** component tests.

The same situation with component **`D`.** The **`F`** component includes the **`G`** one. The **`E`** component includes the **`F`** and **`H`** ones. And, finally, the **`D`** component includes the **`E`** one.

Nice, all the components tree is covered with tests. So what do we have for now?

- We have spent much time covering the components tree with tests as the tests grow exponentially up to the top of the tree.
- If we add or remove some functionality to component **`G`,** we should add the test cases to the **`F, E, and D`** components, as all of them got the additional functionality or some functionality was removed.
- All the components have strong documentation in the code - our test cases are our documentation, so the code review and onboarding are easier.
- If there is a bug inside component **`G`,** the tests for components **`F, E, and D`** will fail - so we know that all of them have incorrect behavior. What is important, we could easily detect the root cause - component **`G`**, as its tests failed too.

## Covering only the Top-Level components

1. Writing the tests for components **`A and D` ,** cover all the scenarios, including the child component's behavior.

Thats all. What do we have in this variant? Actually, we have direct opposition.

- We have spent time covering only the top-level components and obviously, it was faster.
- If add or remove some functionality to the lower-level components, we just need to adjust test cases inside the **`A and D`** tests.
- Only the top-level components are documented.
- If there is a bug inside component **`G`,** the tests for components **`A and D`** will fail - but we could not easily find the root cause, so the time for debugging will be increased.

## Pros and Cons

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Cons</th>
      <th>Pros</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>The tests grow exponentially.</td>
      <td>It is easier to find a component where the bug is present - high confidence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>It is more difficult to keep all the tests up to date. More time for refactoring the components is needed.</td>
      <td>Strong documentation in the code, so the code review and onboarding are easier.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### What do the “Top-Level components”  mean?

The answer depends. I could just recommend the following variants:

**The components that are exported from some module.**

Each project has its module structure. Let’s analyze one of them, based on the **[Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/)** methodology:

```markdown
src/components
  atoms
    Button
    Field
    Image
    MultiSelect
      components
        SelectItem
        SelectSubItem
  molecules
    ButtonsGroup
    Snackbar
      components
        CloseButton
        SeverityIcon
  organisms
    Form
      components
        FormSection
        SubmitButton
```

In this case, the TopLevel components would be the next ones:

- Atoms: Button, Field, Image, MultiSelect
- Molecules: ButtonsGroup, Snackbar
- Organisms: Form

So for integration tests, the coverage of these components would be enough. I don’t need to cover the `SelectItem`, `SelectSubItem` components as they would be tests together with the whole `MultiSelect` one. The same situation with `Snackbar` and `Form` components.

## Conclusion

So what way to choose? In my opinion, ALL the components should be covered with integration tests (100% test coverage) in the:

- open source libraries and projects - most open source projects are small libraries and tools that are reusable in many different situations. So a breakage could lead to a serious problem in a lot of consuming projects. And they're relatively easy to get 100% code coverage on anyway.
- pet projects - it is a good way to fall in love with tests and to understand all the pros and cons of 100% test coverage.

For commercial products, it is enough to cover all the TopLevel cmps with integration tests.

By the way, everyone should always keep in mind **WHY** you cover your components with **integration** tests - [Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests).
