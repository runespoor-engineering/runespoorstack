# TDD

![TDD Flow](/img/tdd.jpeg)

Test-driven development is a programming workflow. A programmer needs to change the behavior of a system (which may be empty just now). 
TDD is intended to help the programmer create a new state of the system where:
- Everything that used to work still works.
- The new behavior works as expected.
- The system is ready for the next change.
- The programmer & their colleagues feel confident in the above points.
