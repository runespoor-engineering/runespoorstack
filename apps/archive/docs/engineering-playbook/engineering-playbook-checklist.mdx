# Engineering Playbook

## Why Have A Playbook

- To increase overall efficiency for team members and the whole team in general.
- To reduce the number of mistakes and avoid common pitfalls.
- To strive to be better engineers and learn from other people's shared experiences.

## Checklist

This checklist helps to ensure that our projects meet our Engineering Fundamentals.

- ✅ Clear documentation of tech stack.
- ✅ The naming convention is documented.
- ✅ Secrets are not part of the commit history or made public.
- ✅ For public repositories, the default branch should contain the following files: Description, [README,](https://github.com/runespoor-engineering/runespoorstack/blob/main/README.md) [Code of conduct,](https://github.com/runespoor-engineering/runespoorstack/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) [Contributing,](https://github.com/runespoor-engineering/runespoorstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) [License,](https://github.com/runespoor-engineering/runespoorstacka/blob/main/LICENSE) [Security policy](https://github.com/runespoor-engineering/runespoorstack/blob/main/SECURITY.md), [Issue templates](https://github.com/runespoor-engineering/runespoorstack/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE), [Pull request template](https://github.com/runespoor-engineering/runespoorstack/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- ✅ The policy over generated code by AI is documented.
- ✅ NPM dependencies have strictly specified versions.

### Testing

- ✅ The Testing Trophy is documented.
- ✅ Test Desiderata is documented.
- ✅ TDD approach is well described.
- ✅ The Testing Conventions are documented.
- ✅ The Testing Strategy is documented.
- ✅ MR checklist contains a point about the required tests adding/updating.
- ✅ Impact Analyses is documented.

### CI/CD

- ✅ [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot) is configured.
- ✅ [Danger](https://github.com/danger/danger-js) is configured.
- ✅ All the tests are automated.
- ✅ [Code coverage](https://about.codecov.io/) reports are configured and automated.
- ✅ Code quality Linters and Prettier are configured and automated.
- ✅ Linters for markdown are configured and automated: [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint), [github-action-markdown-link-check](https://github.com/gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check), [write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good)
- ✅ All the builds and deploys are configured and automated.
- ✅ Bundle-size analyzers are configured and automated.
- ✅ [Copy-Paste analyzer](https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd) is configured and automated.
- ✅ [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) is configured and automated. 
- ✅ The release strategy is documented and automated.
- ✅ The Changelog generation is generated or checked in the CI.

### Security

- ✅ Access is only granted on an as-needed basis
- ✅ Secrets are stored in secured locations and not checked into code
- ✅ Data is encrypted in transit (and if necessary at rest) and passwords are hashed
- ✅ Is the system split into logical segments with a separation of concerns? This helps limit security vulnerabilities.
