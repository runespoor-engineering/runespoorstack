# UI Design Review

UI Design Review is a crucial process that ensures our user interfaces are consistent, accessible,
and aligned with our design principles. Similar to code reviews, having a formalized UI design
review process helps maintain quality and provides clear guidelines for both designers and developers.

This document outlines our UI Design Review process, including:

- When a UI Design Review is required
- Who should participate in the review
- Review criteria and checklist
- How to submit designs for review
- Review deadlines and expectations
- How to handle feedback and iterations
- Exception handling process

A thorough UI Design Review helps prevent common issues like:

- Inconsistent component usage
- Accessibility violations
- Poor responsive behavior
- Deviations from our design system
- User experience issues
- Development performance concerns
- App performance issues

By following this process, we ensure our UI implementations meet our quality standards before
they reach implementation.

For UI review we use **Figma Branching** functionality. Read more:

## When a UI Design Review is required

A UI Design Review is required in the following scenarios:

### New Components or Features
- When introducing new UI components to the design system
- For major feature implementations with significant UI changes
- When creating new page layouts or templates
- When implementing complex interactive elements

### Design System Changes
- Updates to existing design system components
- Changes to design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)
- Modifications to component behavior or interaction patterns
- Introduction of new design patterns or guidelines

### Complex changes is UI
- The review is not required in fixing some UI issues, or adding something really small like one more button/field/etc. to the existing UI.
- But if the changes are complex, and it introduces something new to the screens, then the review is required.

## UI Design Review Formalization

**UI Review frequency:**

- At least 1 review per day.

**UI Review checklist:**
