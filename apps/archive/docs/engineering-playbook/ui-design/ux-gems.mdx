## 1. Clearing state of non-unmountable but closable components

### Suggestions
1. The state of non-unmountable but closable components should be reset when the component is closed.
2. Make sure to reset the state not during closing but when the component is already closed.

**Bad:** In this case the UI will be flickering when the component is closing due to state resetting and React Batching functionality.

```jsx
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

const handleClose = () => {
  // Reset component state
  setIsOpen(false);
};
```

**Good:**

```jsx
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

const handleClose = () => {
  // Reset component state
  setIsOpen(false);
};

useEffect(() => {
  if (!isOpen) {
    // Reset component state
  }
}, [isOpen]);
```
