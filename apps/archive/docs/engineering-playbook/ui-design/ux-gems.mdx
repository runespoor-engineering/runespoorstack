# UX Gems

## 1. Clearing state of non-unmountable but closable components.

### Suggestions
1. The state of non-unmountable but closable components should be reset when the component is closed.
2. Make sure to reset the state not during closing but when the component is already closed.

**Bad:** In this case the UI will be flickering when the component is closing due to state resetting and React Batching functionality.

```jsx
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

const handleClose = () => {
  // Reset component state
  setIsOpen(false);
};
```

**Good:**

```jsx
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

const handleClose = () => {
  setIsOpen(false);
};

useEffect(() => {
  if (!isOpen) {
    // Reset component state
  }
}, [isOpen]);
```

## 2. Add delay for opening tooltips/popovers/etc on hover to avoid flickering, especially when you have list of items and each item has tooltip/popover on hover.

### Suggestions
1. Add 150ms delay to avoid disco during mouse dragging through the items that have tooltips/popovers/etc on hover.

## 3. Open only external links in new tab.

### Suggestions
1. Internal links should open in the same tab, allowing users to navigate within your application naturally.
2. External links should open in a new tab to prevent users from completely leaving your application.

**Why INTERNAL links should NOT open in a new tab:**
- It overrides the user's preferred browsing behavior and takes away their control - user should decide how to open the link by themselves
- It breaks the browser's back button functionality
- It creates multiple tabs of your application, increasing browser memory usage
- It can confuse users about their navigation path within your application

**Why EXTERNAL links SHOULD open in a new tab:**
- It keeps users engaged with your application while allowing them to explore external content
- It prevents users from accidentally leaving your site
- It creates a clear separation between your content and external resources
- It helps users maintain their context within your application
