title: Issues To Keep Track On
---

The "Issues To Keep Track On" page is a valuable resource for a project team or organization to maintain transparency, collaboration, 
and efficiency. It serves several purposes:

1. **Transparency**: It allows everyone involved in the project to have a clear understanding of the issues that are being worked on or 
need attention. This helps to avoid duplication of efforts and ensures that everyone is aware of the current status of the project.
2. **Collaboration**: By documenting issues and their solutions, the team can collaborate more effectively. Team members can refer to the 
page to understand the context of a particular issue, its status, and the proposed solution. This can help in making informed decisions 
and ensuring that everyone is on the same page.
3. **Efficiency**: By keeping track of issues, the team can prioritize their work more effectively. They can focus on resolving the most 
critical issues first, ensuring that the project progresses smoothly. This can help in avoiding delays and ensuring that the project 
stays on track.
4. **Learning**: The "Issues To Keep Track On" page can also serve as a learning resource. By documenting the issues and their solutions, 
the team can learn from past experiences and avoid making the same mistakes in the future. This can help in improving the overall 
quality of the project.

      <td>It seems that if success case is run first, handlers, that are supposed to override it, will be ignored. If I move this
        kind of test to be run in the beginning, the whole suite passes. If test is run in isolation it will also pass. If I move it to 
        the end, after tests which used default handler run, it will fail because handler override is ignored.</td>
