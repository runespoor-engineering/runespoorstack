# Managing dependencies

## Choosing npm packages

Suppose you need to select a library, and you already know the requirements for which you are searching for this library. Here's what to consider when making the final decision:

- **Bundle size.** - Compare the bundle size of each package using https://pkg-size.dev/.
- **Over engineering.** - Evaluate how much unnecessary functionality this package offers. If it affects the bundle size, it's better to look for alternatives.
- **Popularity.** - The number of GitHub stars and monthly downloads.
- **Activity.** - How recently and how often the package has been updated? Activity in terms of issues and pull requests.
- **Code quality.** - Read the source code of the package.

## Updating npm package versions

- Do not hurry to upgrade to major versions (especially in the context of big frameworks like Next.js), waite for at least 1-2 minor/patch versions afterward (unless it is needed and we embraced the risks).
- When updating a version, carefully read the package's **Changelog** to avoid breaking changes.
- **Test** all the functionality related to the updated package.

## How to manage dependency versions

- **Strictly specify versions of all npm packages**. - [Do not use any symbols](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies) (`^`, `~`, etc.) - this can lead to sudden bugs, as you might easily overlook that some packages have been updated, miss testing-related functionality, fail to inform QA about it, and as a result, deliver bugs to production.
- Use [dependabot](https://docs.github.com/ru/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot).
- Use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates)

## Choosing a Dependency Manager

- Use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) - This is just one recommendation, but it's too big of a topic to discuss here.
