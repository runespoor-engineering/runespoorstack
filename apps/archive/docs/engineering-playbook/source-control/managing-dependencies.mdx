# Managing Dependencies

## Choosing npm Packages

Suppose you need to select a library, and you already know the requirements for which you are searching. Here's what to consider when making the final decision:

- **Bundle size** - Compare the bundle size of each package using https://pkg-size.dev/.
- **Over-engineering** - Evaluate how much unnecessary functionality this package offers. If it affects the bundle size, it's better to look for alternatives.
- **Popularity** - The number of GitHub stars and monthly downloads.
- **Activity** - How recently and how often the package has been updated? Activity in terms of issues and pull requests.
- **Code quality** - Read the source code of the package.
- **Documentation** - How well documented is the package.

## Updating npm Package Versions

- Do not hurry to upgrade to major versions (especially in the context of big frameworks like Next.js). Wait for at least 1-2 minor/patch versions afterward (unless it is needed and we have embraced the risks).
- When updating a version, carefully read the package's **Changelog** to avoid breaking changes.
- **Test** all functionality related to the updated package.

## How to Manage Dependency Versions

- **Strictly specify versions of all npm packages** - [Do not use any symbols](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies) (`^`, `~`, etc.) - this can lead to sudden bugs, as you might easily overlook that some packages have been updated, miss testing related functionality, fail to inform QA about it, and as a result, deliver bugs to production.
- Use [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/ru/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot).
- Use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates).
- Use [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) (Recommended).

## Choosing a Dependency Manager

- Use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) - This is just one recommendation, but it's too big of a topic to discuss here.
