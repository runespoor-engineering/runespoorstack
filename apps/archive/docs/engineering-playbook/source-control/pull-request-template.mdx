# Pull Request Template

Here is an example of a Pull Request template I commonly use on my projects. It is just an example and you could (should) adopt this template based on your project specific.

I suggest you use it in collaboration with GitHub, and GitLab abilities:

- [GitLab Description template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html)
- [GitHub PR templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)

## GitHub / GitLab Template

```markdown
- [ ]  Changes were structured by the logical commits/MRs: one logical change - one commit/MR.
