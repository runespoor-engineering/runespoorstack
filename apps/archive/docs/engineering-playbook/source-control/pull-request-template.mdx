# Pull Request Template

Here is an example of a Pull Request template I commonly use in my projects. It is just an example, and you should adapt this template based on your project's specific needs.

I suggest you use it in collaboration with GitHub and GitLab capabilities:

- [GitLab Description template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html)
- [GitHub PR templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)

## GitHub / GitLab Template

```markdown
- [ ]  Changes were structured by logical commits/MRs: one logical change - one commit/MR.
- [ ]  MR pipeline is green.
- [ ]  Tests are added/updated (if relevant).
- [ ]  Changes are fully described in the MR description.
- [ ]  [Impact Analysis](https://dev.to/borysshulyak/impact-analysis-unleashing-the-power-of-understanding-code-dependencies-4ma6) was provided.
- [ ]  The related MRs are linked to the current one (if relevant).
