# Bug Issue Template

Here is an example of a Bug Issue template I commonly use on my projects. It is just an example and you could (should) adopt this template based on your project specific.

I suggest you use it in collaboration with GitHub, and GitLab abilities:

- [GitLab Description template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html)
- [GitHub issue template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/manually-creating-a-single-issue-template-for-your-repository)

## GitHub Template

A [minimal reproduction](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) is required ([Why?](https://antfu.me/posts/why-reproductions-are-required)). If a report is vague (e.g. just a generic error message) and has no reproduction, it will receive a "need reproduction" label.

      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: reproduction-steps
    attributes:
      label: Steps to reproduce

```
