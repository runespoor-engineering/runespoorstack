# Feature Issue Template

Here is an example of a Feature Issue template I commonly use on my projects. It is just an example and you could (should) adopt this template based on your project specific.

I suggest you use it in collaboration with GitHub, and GitLab abilities:

- [GitLab Description template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html)
- [GitHub issue template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/manually-creating-a-single-issue-template-for-your-repository)

## GitHub Template

```yaml
name: ✨ Feature Request
description: Suggest an idea for this project.
labels: ['type::feature', 'workflow::backlog validation']
title: '[✨]'
body:
  - type: textarea
    id: use_case
    attributes:
      label: 'Is your feature request related to a problem?'
      description: "A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]"
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: solution
    attributes:
      label: "Describe the solution you'd like"
      description: 'A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.'
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: alternatives
    attributes:
      label: "Describe alternatives you've considered"
      description: "A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered."
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: additional_context
    attributes:
      label: 'Additional context'
      description: 'Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.'
    validations:
      required: false
```
