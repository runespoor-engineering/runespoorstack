# Docs Issue Template

Here is an example of the Docs Suggestion template I commonly use on my projects. It is just an example and you could (should) adopt this template based on your project specific.

I suggest you use it in collaboration with GitHub, and GitLab abilities:

- [GitLab Description template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html)
- [GitHub issue template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/manually-creating-a-single-issue-template-for-your-repository)

## GitHub Template

```yaml
name: ðŸ“– Documentation Suggestion
description: Suggestions on how we can improve the documentation.
title: '[ðŸ“–]'
labels: ['type::maintenance', 'workflow::problem validation']
body:
  - type: markdown
    attributes:
      value: |
        Thanks for taking the time to fill out docs suggestion! However, if you think it's something you can fix yourself, please submit a PR instead.
        In every doc page, you will be able to find the "Edit this page" in the right menu!

  - type: textarea
    id: description
    attributes:
      description: 'A clear and concise description of your suggestion to improve the docs.'
      label: Suggestion
    validations:
      required: true
```
