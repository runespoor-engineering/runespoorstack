# Simple React Files Structure

There is a few silver bullet rules for (modules) **hooks**, **utils**, **types**, **constants**, **components**, etc. placing:
- If it is a general module - it should be placed on the highest level (e.g. src).
- If it is used in 2 or more modules - it should be placed on the higher level of it's usage or in the goup folder.

## Src

```
src/
  api - is used for everything related to server API (api, hooks, types, parsers).
  assets - is used for static asserts.
  app - is used App.tsx component.
  components - is used for as a root components folder
  hooks - general (shared) hooks.
  hocs - general (shared) HOCs.
  utils - general (shared) utils.
  types - general (shared) types.
  constants - general (shared) constants.
  context - general (shared) context.
  stories - general stories, documentation.
  test - tests setup files.
  config - app configuration files.
```

## Api

- **api.ts** - file for api ednpoints.
- **hooks.ts** - file for api hooks (e.g. wrapers over `useQuery`, `useMutation` in case of Tanstack Query).
- **types** - folder for the server api entities, payload, and responses types.
- **parsers.ts** - file for the server api response parsers.

```
api /
  <group1>
    api.ts
    hooks.ts
    types / 
      payloads.ts
      responses.ts
      common.ts
    parsers.ts
  <groupN>
    api.ts
    hooks.ts
    types / 
      payloads.ts
      responses.ts
      common.ts
    parsers.ts
```

## Root Components Folder

- Follow the [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) in organization of your high level exported components.
- Create the separate **group** folders to split you components by entities or anything else (e.g. shared, games, domains).
- Inside the **group** folder create the **atoms**, **molecules**, **organisms** folders.
- Inside the **atoms**, **molecules**, **organisms** folders create the separate folders for each component.
- **templates** and **pages** are so high level components so they are not spit by the groups.

```
src/
components /
  templates 
  pages
  <group1> / 
    organisms
      <Component1>
    molecules
      <Component2>
    atoms
      <Component3>
  <group2> /
    organisms
    molecules
    atoms
```

## Component

- **hooks** - folder for hooks related to this component directly or 2 or more components in the `<Comonent1>/components` folder.
- **utils** - folder for utility functions related to this component directly or 2 or more components in the `<Comonent1>/components` folder.
- **types** - folder for types related to this component directly or 2 or more components in the `<Comonent1>/components` folder.
- **constants** - folder for constants related to this component directly or 2 or more components in the `<Comonent1>/components` folder.
- **context** - folder for context related to this component directly.
- **components** - folder for nested components. 
  - If some components are used only in this component, they should be placed under this component.
  - If some components are used in 2 or more components, they should be placed on the higher level.
- **stories** - folder for stories related to this component directly.
- **__tests__/integration** - folder for tests related to this component directly.

```
<Component1>
  Component1.tsx
  hooks
  utils
  types
  constants
  context
  components
  stories
  __tests__/integration
```

## Hooks

```
hooks /
  <group1>
    <useFunctionality1>
    <useFunctionality2>
  <groupN>
    <useFunctionalityN>
```

## Hook

- **utils** - folder for utility functions related for this hook directly.
- **types** - folder for types related for this hook directly.
- **constants** - folder for constants related for this hook directly.
- **__tests__** - folder for tests related for this hook directly.

```
<useFunctionality1>
  useFunctionality1.tsx
  utils
  types
  constants
  __tests__/unit
```

## Utils

```
utils /
  <group1>
    <util1>
    <util2>
  <groupN>
    <utilN>
```

## Util

- **types** - folder for types related for this util directly.
- **constants** - folder for constants related for this util directly.
- **__tests__** - folder for tests related for this util directly.

```
<util1>
  util1.tsx
  types
  constants
  __tests__/unit
```

## Types

```
types /
  <group1>
    <type1>.tsx
    <type2>.tsx
  <groupN>
    <typeN>.tsx
```

## Constants

```
constants /
  <group1>
    <constant1>.ts
    <constant2>.ts
  <groupN>
    <constantN>.ts
```

## Context

- **Context1.tsx** - Use the singe file for Context and Provider.
- Athor folders follow the same rules.

```
context /
  <group1>
    <Context1> / 
      Context1.tsx
      hooks
      utils
      types
      constants
      components
      stories
      __tests__/integration
  <groupN>
    <ContextN>
```

## hocs

```
hocs /
  <group1>
    <hoc1>
    <hoc2>
  <groupN>
    <hocN>
```

## Stories

```
stories /
  <Component1>.stories.tsx
```
