# PR / Issue Labels

Here you can see the list of labels I recommend you use in your project.

## Why do you need the configured project labels in your GitHub / GitLab repository?

- Categorization of epics, issues, and merge requests using colors and descriptive titles like `bug`, `feature request`, or `docs`.
- Dynamically filter and manage epics, issues, and merge requests.
- Search lists of issues, merge requests, and epics, as well as issue boards.

## Labels Template

### Type Labels

- `"type::bug"`: Defects in shipped code and fixes for those defects.
    - `"bug::performance"`: Performance defects or response time degradation.
    - `"bug::availability"`
    - `"bug::vulnerability"`: Defects related to Security Vulnerabilities.
    - `"bug::mobile"`: Defects encountered on Mobile Devices.
    - `"bug::functional"`: Functional defects resulting from feature changes.
    - `"bug::ux"`: Unexpected and unintended behavior that is detrimental to the user experience.
- `"type::feature"`: Effort to deliver new features, feature changes & improvements.
    - `"feature::addition"`
    - `"feature::enhancement"`
    - `"feature::consolidation"`
- `"type::maintenance"`: Upkeeping efforts & catch-up corrective improvements that are not Features nor Bugs. This includes removing or altering feature flags, removing whole features, merge requests that only include new specs or tests, documentation updates/changes (not including new documentation), restructuring for long-term maintainability, stability, reducing technical debt, improving the contributor experience, or upgrading dependencies and packages.
    - `"maintenance::refactor"`: Simplifying or restructuring existing code or documentation.
    - `"maintenance::removal"`: Deprecation and removal of functionality when it's no longer needed.
    - `"maintenance::dependency"`: Dependency updates and their version upgrades.
    - `"maintenance::usability"`: General improvements to product usability that are unrelated to feature prioritization.
    - `"maintenance::test-gap"`: Test coverage improvements that were not included in feature prioritization.
    - `"maintenance::pipelines"`: Pipeline related changes.
    - `"maintenance::workflow"`: Improvements of the engineering tooling like linters, issue templates, etc.
- `"type::content"`: Everything related to branding/marketing/blogging or other content (e.g. videos, blog posts, articles).

### Workflow labels

Issues and MRs use the following workflow labels to specify the current status:

- `"workflow::blocked"`
- `"workflow::complete"`
- `"workflow::feature-flagged"`
- `"workflow::planning breakdown"`
- `"workflow::problem validation"`
- `"workflow::production"`
- `"workflow::ready for design"`
- `"workflow::ready for development"`
- `"workflow::refinement"`
- `"workflow::scheduling"`
- `"workflow::solution validation"`
- `"workflow::backlog validation"`
- `"workflow::verification"`
- `"workflow::development"`: Add this label to the PR/Issue if it is in progress.
- `"workflow::review"`: Add this label to the PR if it is ready for review.
- `"workflow::approved"`: Add this label to the PR if you are the last reviewer (the author is waiting only for your review) and you approve it.
- `"workflow::revoked"`: Add this label to the PR/Issue if you have some comments to the PR/Issie and requesting the answers or changes.

### Specialization labels

These labels narrow the specialization on a unit of work.

- `"frontend"`
- `"backend"`
- `"documentation"`
