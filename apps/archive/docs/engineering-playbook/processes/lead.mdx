# 4 Points of Leadership

We all want to improve the processes in our company/team. For this, we all need good leaders.

## Fairness

For every person on the team to feel good, fairness must be present. It is very difficult for one person to implement the concept of fairness.

What can a leader provide in this context? - Assess the situation: whether it is fair or not.

## The inevitability of Reward, The Inescapability of Punishment

Every player should know that if they do something good, they will be rewarded. This reward doesn't necessarily have to be monetary. The leader should provide rewards using the resources they have: words, mentions, and posts in common channels expressing gratitude or words of respect.

On the other hand, the leader should not be a barrier between the team and the external world. They should not shield the team from all impacts while taking all the hits themselves. Each person should understand that they are fully responsible for their decisions and actions. The leader's task is to manage this: some people need to be told about their mistakes with pressure, some need to be approached and told, "You did everything well, but...," some need a full explanation of the consequences, and for some, it's better not to mention them. The key is to keep in mind that certain wording may irritate one person but be acceptable to another.

## Patience, Authority, Evidence

You should never (with very rare exceptions) start abruptly and radically changing or building processes. This is associated with many factors.

First, it's people's mentality. Most people are not accustomed to change in their lives. It may sound harsh, but it's true. People are afraid of changes. People are skeptical about changes. People find it difficult and lazy to change and reshape their thinking. Therefore, bursting into an office and waving a chess piece while saying, "Everything is bad now, I know how to make it better, and we are starting a new path," is not acceptable. **Be patient.**

How can you understand when it's time to implement new practices? It's very simple. This time comes when there is **authority** in the team. What am I talking about? You need to understand that if you were given a leadership position, manager role, or CTO role, it doesn't mean you are an authority figure for the team. No, that's not enough. Authority is assigned and accepted in different ways within different teams. If you are the leader of a development team, you need to demonstrate your technical skills, show that you can act in difficult and tense situations, and show that you know what you're dealing with.

Only after that will people start to listen to you and take your words seriously.

Okay, you have achieved that your team listens to you. The job is almost done. But to completely overcome the resistance to change, you need evidence. Evidence that if they agree with you and follow you, something will become better. For this, you need to demonstrate your analytical, oratory, and presentation skills. Create **"bad meters"**! Show through statistics, diagrams, and charts that things are not going well now. It's even better if you can show that with the current approach, things will be much harder in the future. And only after that, provide a comparative analysis of what you offer.

## Willingness to Put the Skin in the Game

You must show the team through all your actions that you are playing the same game. If the rules of the game change, everyone, including you, should

play by those rules.

What am I talking about? Let me explain with a quick example: if you are implementing a merge request policy in the company, you should not directly push commits to the master branch yourself.
