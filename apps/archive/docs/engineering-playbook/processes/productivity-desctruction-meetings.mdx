# Productivity Destruction: Meetings

## How destruction works in term of productivity

Concentration plays a very important role in an engineer's productivity. We have too many different tasks and 
events that we need to remember and think about - and this takes its toll, as our brain tends to 
become overloaded and tired.

Let's look at examples of the most common distractions during an engineer's work (we won't talk about TikTok 
or Reels, as we're only considering work-related matters). There aren't that many, but this doesn't 
prevent them from being critical in terms of productivity. Setting aside the code review process, which needs 
to be done as often and quickly as possible, we're left with only communication with other people, namely: 
Messages in messengers (Slack) and everyone's favorite meetings.

What happens when we get distracted by such things?

There is a common misconception about how interruptions affect our productivity. We often assume that after a 
short meeting or responding to a Slack message, we almost instantly return to our previous level of productivity 
(as shown by the red dotted line on the graph). However, reality looks completely different.

In fact, after each interruption of the work process (blue line), it takes significant time to return to the 
original level of productivity. The brain needs to re-immerse itself in the context of the task, restore the 
train of thought, and achieve a state of deep concentration. This process can take from 15 to 30 minutes even 
after a brief distraction.

An even more serious problem arises with frequent interruptions throughout the day. As shown in the lower 
graph, when we're just beginning to restore productivity after one meeting, the next interruption occurs. 
As a result, we spend the entire day trying to gain momentum but never reach the optimal level of productivity.
We find ourselves in a constant state of "almost productivity," never achieving the flow state necessary for 
solving complex engineering problems.
