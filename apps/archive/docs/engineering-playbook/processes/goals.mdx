# Goals

Each change should have a goal. When we talk about processes, the goals of process changes vary depending on the type of project.

**Startup.** The goal of a startup is to prove or disprove the theory of the project idea's success. Accordingly, process changes/implementations should help achieve the end goal even faster.

**Product.** Here it gets more interesting. When a project transitions into the product stage, the technical debt in its codebase quickly accumulates, which can consume a significant amount of resources if it exceeds acceptable limits. Therefore, process changes/implementations should help effectively fulfill business requirements while reducing technical debt and establishing a codebase that can serve for decades.

**Outsourcing.** Here it's quite simple. We build good processes to easily and seamlessly replace any participant in this process. This is the main goal of processes in outsourcing. However, we can also transfer the same goal to the product.
