# Continuous Integration

I would like to write a lot of things about integration here, but it is too hard to create more understandable and fully-describe
guide than the following once.

In order to follow this methodology, you must know and follow every word from this material.

- [Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches](https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html#continuous-integration)
- [Continuous Integration](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html)
- [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/continuous-integration/)
- [Feature Toggles (aka Feature Flags)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html)
- [Continuous Delivery](https://continuousdelivery.com/)

## Recommendations

- Follow the "Engineering Playbook/**Agile**" section.
- Follow the "Engineering Playbook/**Source Control**" section.
- Follow the "Engineering Playbook/**Testing**" section.
- Follow the "Engineering Playbook/**Code Review**" section.
- Follow the "Engineering Playbook/**Processes/Critical Chain**" section.
- Follow the "Engineering Playbook/**Processes/The delay in managerial decision-making**" section.
- CI Automation:
  - All the tests, including static once, are automated.
  - Linters for markdown are configured and automated: [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint), [github-action-markdown-link-check](https://github.com/gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check), [write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good)
  - All the builds and deploys are configured and automated.
  - [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot) is configured.
  - [Danger](https://github.com/danger/danger-js) is configured.
  - [Code coverage](https://about.codecov.io/) reports are configured and automated.  
  - Bundle-size analyzers are configured and automated.
  - [Copy-Paste analyzer](https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd) is configured and automated.
  - [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) is configured and automated. 
  - The release strategy is documented and automated.
  - The Changelog generation is generated or checked in the CI.
  - Configure the integration between CI servie and your company's communication platform (e.g. Slack) to be quickly notified about the failed pipelines.
- CI Tools:
  - Use [PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) as a Feature Flaxgs service.
  - Use **GitHub Actions**/**GitLab CI** as a CI service.
  - Use [SonarCube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) as an additional code quality tool.
