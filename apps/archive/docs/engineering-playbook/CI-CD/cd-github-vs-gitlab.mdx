# Continuous Delivery: GitHub vs GitLab

![Continuous Delivery: GitHub vs GitLab](/img/cd-github-vs-gitlab.png)

## GitHub:

Github does not support manual jobs out of the box. We can only create manually triggered workflows.

- On the image we could see the GitHub Continuous Delivery mainline - a manually triggered workflow for deploying to production runs only on the latest commit in our mainline branch.
- Only the last deployed commit is marked as deployable, with no deployment actions along the way.
- Rollback is indicated on one of the earlier commits that was deployed to production.

Conclusion: We don't have an ability to deploy any version of the mainline branch, only the latest commit.

## GitLab

- In the GitLab workflow, each Conitnuous Delivery pipeline on the mainline its own manual `Deploy to Prod` job, and each successful deployment is labeled as "Deployed".
- Each commit is marked as deployable.
- Rollback is indicated on one of the earlier commits that was deployed to production.

Conclusion: We have an ability to deploy any version of the mainline branch, not only the latest commit.

## Conclusion

GitLab provides a more flexible approach to deployment, improves Continuous Delivery process, and provides easier rollback options.
