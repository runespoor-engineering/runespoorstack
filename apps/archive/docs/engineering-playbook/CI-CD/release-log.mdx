# Release Log
The Release Log is a crucial tool for tracking and managing software releases in our CI/CD pipeline. 
It provides a comprehensive overview of all production deployments, making it easier to monitor the health of 
our releases and quickly respond to any issues that may arise.

## Purpose

The release log serves several key purposes:

1. **Version Tracking**: Maintains a clear record of which versions were deployed and when
2. **Rollback Management**: Documents rollback points for quick recovery if needed
3. **Pipeline Traceability**: Links directly to build pipelines for debugging
4. **Release Health Monitoring**: Tracks broken releases to identify patterns

## Log Structure

We track the following information for each release in the following way:

| Release Number | App Version | Rollback Release Number | Pipeline Link | Release Date | Is Broken |
|---------------|-------------|------------------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
