# CMD+C/CMD+V? Never More!

👨‍💻 If you are a FullStackOverflow engineer, this article is for you!
🚀 If you are the “I will implement this feature for 10 minutes”, this article is for you!
🧹 If you are a Software Engineer that loves refactoring and clean code, this article is **especially** for you!
This article is about one stage of code refactoring!

## Let’s imagine you have started code refactoring …

You have covered your code with `eslint`, isolated the bad code, logged it, written the wrapper with your clean code, and covered it with tests. Nicely done!

You have merged it - everything works fine! After that, You removed the bad code, and looks like your refactoring has successfully finished.

But … after a few weeks, you open another part of your project, or even another project (in case of monorepo), and **Surprise - you have met your old friend, Mr. The Same Bad Code.** A terrible story, isn't it?

In such a situation, there is no need to despair and slam the lid of the laptop! Just…

## Integrate the copy-paste analyzer in your CI/CD process

Have you ever heard about such tools? No? Okay, I’m going to introduce the one.

🔎 Introducing **[jscpd](https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd/tree/master)**! Let's dive in and start using it!

You could just write the following commands and get the profit:

```markup
npm install -g jscpd
npx jscpd /path/to/source
```

### What about the abilities?

Available reporters:

- **console** - report about clones to console;
- **consoleFull** - report about clones to console with blocks of code;
- **json** - output `jscpd-report.json` file with clones report in json format;
- **xml** - output `jscpd-report.xml` file with clones report in xml format;
- **csv** - output `jscpd-report.csv` file with clones report in csv format;
- **markdown** - output `jscpd-report.md` file with clones report in markdown format;
- **html** - generate html report to `html/` folder;
- **verbose** - output a lot of debug information to console;

You could easily integrate it in your CI/CD tool and be happy to remove the copy-paste in your project!

You could event generate **badge** for your project to let your colleagues not forget about the terrible copy-paste numbers in your code base. Just use the **[badge reporter](https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd/tree/master/packages/badge-reporter)!**

Wanna to integrate it as a code? No problems, the **jscpd** also provide an JS API to use it.
See an example: 

```jsx
import {IClone} from '@jscpd/core';
import {jscpd} from 'jscpd';
(async () => {
  const clones: IClone[] = await jscpd(['', '', __dirname + '/../fixtures', '-m', 'weak', '--silent']);
  console.log(clones);
})();
```

## What will you get as a result?
