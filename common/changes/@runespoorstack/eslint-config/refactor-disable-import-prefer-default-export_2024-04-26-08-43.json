      "comment": "`base-js`, `base-ts`, `react-js`, `react-ts`: <br/>- Disable `import/prefer-default-export` rule due to the frequent eslint disables in the codebases. The decision was made based on the following discussion - [What is the benefit of prefer-default-export?](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1365). We have also decided not to disable default exports with `import/no-default-exports` as a lot of default exports might be a part of specification, like storybook configs or any other file-based frameworks.",
